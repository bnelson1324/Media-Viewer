This program lets you add tags to files in order to sort them.


To add/remove files:
Go to the root storage folder (can be opened in the Settings tab) and add/remove files from that folder. Added files will automatically be tagged with "untagged".


To search for files by tag:
Go to the search tab, enter a tag such as "untagged", and press enter.
Entering an empty search will show all files in the root storage folder.
You can search for multiple tags at once using the operators && (and), or || (or) between tags. For example, the search "desktop background && outdoors" would show all files with both the tags "desktop background" and "outdoors".


To select a file to view/modify tags for:
There are two ways to do this.
1) Click on it in the Search tab. This will automatically take you to the View tab.
2) Enter its file location relative to the root storage folder in the View/Modify Tags tab, and press enter.


To modify a file's tags:
Select the file as described above. Then, go to the Modify Tags tab.
Enter tags into the text fields, separating tags by comma. For example, the tags field could have "desktop background, outdoors" entered.
Then, press the save tags button.


Entering dates:
Dates should be entered following the date format in the Settings tab. The default format is YYYY/MM/DD.
For example, a dateCreated field could have "1987/12/04" entered.


To change the date format:
Go to the Settings tab and go to the date format field. Enter a date format, where "Y" is year, "M" is month, and "D" is day. This is not case-sensitive.


Implicit tags:
The program will automatically add some tags available for searching, but not seen in the Modify Tags tab. This section describes all of these implicit tags.
fileFormat: the file format of a file (example: fileFormat:png)
mediaType: the type of media a file is (example: mediaType:image)
yearCreated/monthCreated/dayCreated/yearAdded/monthAdded/dayAdded: part of a date for when a file was created/added (examples: monthCreated:may, dayAdded:14, yearCreated:2006, monthAdded:december)
